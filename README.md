## Tide Monitoring, Water Level Detection, and Early Flood Warnings

We installed poles at various flood-prone locations to measure tide height and standing water levels. Cameras were set up to continuously monitor these areas. Using computer vision techniques, we analyze the footage to detect water height changes and provide early flood warnings.

This is a project in progress. 
We want to share some results from our experiments + difficulties we encountered :nerd_face:. 

*It is worth noting that images were taken on the day of Hurricane Helene

### :test_tube:What is the next?
* Improving current approaches by finding the most generalizable image preprocessing techniques
* Experimenting with Object Detection
