## Tide Monitoring, Water Level Detection, and Early Flood Warnings

We installed poles at various flood-prone locations to measure tide height and standing water levels. Cameras were set up to continuously monitor these areas. Using computer vision techniques, we analyze the footage to detect water height changes and provide early flood warnings.

This is a project in progress. 
We want to share some results from our experiments + difficulties we encountered. :nerd_face:
